Pull in validator and is-empty dependencies

Export the function validateRegisterInput, which takes in data as a parameter (sent from our frontend registration form)

Instantiate our errors object

Convert all empty fields to an empty string before running validation checks (validator only works with strings)

Check for empty fields, valid email formats, password requirements and confirm password equality using validator functions

Return our errors object with any and all errors contained as well as an isValid boolean that checks to see if we have any errors
