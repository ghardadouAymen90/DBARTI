Pull in our required dependencies (namely express, mongoose and bodyParser)

Initialize our app using express()

Apply the middleware function for bodyparser so we can use it

Pull in our MongoURI from our keys.js file and connect to our MongoDB database

require routes and passport. Use passport as a middleware, configure passport and declare routes

Set the port for our server to run on and have our app listen on this port

Added proxy to package.json to be able in axios to request axios.post(‘api/users/register') 
instead of axios.post(‘http://localhost:5000/api/users/register');
